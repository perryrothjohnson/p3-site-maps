## P3 site maps

A webpage to track progress of the P3 construction site. It collects assets captured by a DJI Mavic Air 2 drone and products processed via [Maps Made Easy](https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com), including orthomosaic maps, before-and-after images, aerial photos, and 3D models.

### before-and-after images

The [before and after](https://perryrothjohnson.github.io/p3-site-maps/slider.html) page uses [TwentyTwenty](https://zurb.com/playground/twentytwenty), a visual diff tool, to compare images captured on different days with an interactive slider.  

See [this how-to video](https://youtu.be/4Z3NWAyFtS0) for more details on setting up the TwentyTwenty jQuery plugin. More details and the full source code also available [here](https://github.com/zurb/twentytwenty).
